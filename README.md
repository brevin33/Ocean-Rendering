# Ocean Rendering

This project creates a ocean using a frequency spectrum to get a fully formed ocean I use the Philips spectrum. Then I perform a Inverse FFT to generate a hight map from the frequency spectrum. Rendering for this project is done using my Mezermize Renderer(https://github.com/brevin33/MesmerizeRenderer).
